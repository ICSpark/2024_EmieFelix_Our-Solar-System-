  <h1>Mars</h1>
 <p> Welcome to Mars The Red Planet! Mars get it's nickname becuase it is obviously red due to the iron materials oxidating or rusting, but it's name derives from the Roman God of War, Mars. Scientists are currently searching for signs of life on Mars that existed long ago since it was warmer and covered with water. A full rotation of Mars or day is about 24.6 hours and an orbit is or year is 687 Earth days. Like Earth, Mars also has moons. Not only one but two!  Phobos and Deimos are both potato shaped due to their little mass which doesn't make them spherical enough.</p>
