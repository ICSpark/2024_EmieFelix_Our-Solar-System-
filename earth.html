  <h1>Earth</h1>
 <p> Welcome, to the floating rock we call home! Earth is perfect for us humans to live on. Earth has the right chemical ingredients for life such as water, carbon and oxygen. The sun isn't burning our surface like Mercury. Unlike Venus, the atmosphere isn't very thick so not much heat is stored (although we have climate change occuring). On Earth we also have enough resources to survive such as food, water, and materials for shelter. Water, otherwise known as H2O is available for us to consume and refuel our bodies. Plants and animals are available for us to eat so we can get our nutrition to make our bodies function properly. </p>

  <p id = "dart"> NASA created the DART mission</p>
  <p> The Double Asteroid Redirection Test is NASA's current solution to avoiding collisions with Asteroids. This involves sending a spacecraft to purposely crash into an asteroid at high speeds, changing it's course. NASA tested this back in Nov. 24, 2021. Refresh the page to see this in action again.</p>
