  <p id = "cry"> Voyager 1 was launched back in Sep. 5, 1977. This craft's mission is to explore interstellar space, the space beyond the Kuiper Belt and Outer Solar System. Voyager 1 is still active and alive. Before Voyager 1 left us, it took one last picture of Earth known as, "The Pale Blue Dot." While everybody was celebrating Valentines on Feb. 14, 1990, Voyager 1 was looking down at us one last time.</p>
