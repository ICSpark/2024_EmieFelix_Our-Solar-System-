  <h1>Jupiter</h1>
<p> Welcome to Jupiter! Unlike the four previous planets, which are Terrestrial, from this point on, the planets are classified as Gas Giants. Characteristics of Gas Planets include being composed of mainly helium and or hydrogen, and having a bunch of clouds swirl over the core. So there is no surface for us to land on! Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system and named after the King of Gods in Roman mythology. (Zeus in Greek). Jupiter surprisingly has the shortest day, 10 Earth Hours, but the longest orbit coming in at 12 Earth years. Jupiter has the same ingredients of the star like the sun so it has similar structure and composition to it. Unfortunately, Jupiter is a failed star :(</p>

  <p> Unlike Earth, Jupiter has multiple moons. How much moons exactly? There are less than a hundred moons in Jupiter. Put in a number and guess to find out :)</p>
