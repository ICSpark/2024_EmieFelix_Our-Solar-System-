  <h1>Moon</h1>
 <p> Welcome to the moon! This natural satellite (anything that orbits a planet or a star) is our only natural satellite. From these missions we learned that the moon has traces of water and ice. The moon's orbit would be around 27 Earth days, similar to how much days we have on our calendar. The moon is believed to have formed because a Mars sized object collided with Ancient Earth several billions of years ago, leaving the moon out to orbit.</p>

  <p> The moon is the only astronaumical object in space that we humans have landed on. This occured in the Apollo Mission 11 mission, July 20, 1969 during the Cold War between America and the USSR. They left many objects behind. <br> Type "true" or "false" into the input boxes to see if they were actually left on the moon.</br></p>
