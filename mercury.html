  <h1>Mercury</h1>
 <p> Welcome to the smallest planet in our solar system! Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's moon, and the closest to the sun. It's temperature ranges from at most, 800 degrees Farenheight to the low -290 degrees farenheight. The planet's surface resembels the Moon's and gets them from collisions from meteors and comets. Since it is the closest, the orbit would be 88 days. </p>
