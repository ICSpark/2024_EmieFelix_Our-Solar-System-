  <h1>Uranus</h1>
<p>Welcome to Uranus! One of the Ice Giants since it's full of icy materials such as water, ammonai and methane! Methane is the reason why Uranus looks blue. A day on Uranus is 10.7 hours while a year is 84 Earth years or a Uranian year. The atmosphere of Uranus consists of mainly helium and hydrogen. Uranus has 28 known moons and has rings. There are two sets of rings, inner and outer. The 9 inner rings are mostly narrow and dark grey. There are also 2 outer rings with the innermost reddish and dusty while the outer is blue. </p>
